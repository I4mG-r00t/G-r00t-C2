## Step 1: Setting Up Core C2 Functionality in C

    Start with Basic Agent-Server Communication:
        Implement basic HTTP communication between the C2 agent and server.
        Use libcurl for HTTP requests if you're working in C, as it’s lightweight and supports SSL/TLS, which is helpful for encrypted channels.
        Alternatively, you can build a custom socket-based protocol over TCP for more control, though this will require handling SSL/TLS directly or adding your own encryption layer.

    Implement Agent Check-ins:
        Write a function that checks in with the C2 server at regular intervals, requesting commands.
        Start with plaintext communication for simplicity, and then layer encryption on top once you have basic functionality.

## Step 2: Adding Encryption with AES and RSA

Encryption is essential for C2 frameworks to avoid detection and secure data in transit. Here’s how to approach it in C:

    Select an Encryption Library:
        OpenSSL: Offers a robust implementation of both AES and RSA. It’s well-documented and widely used, making it a good choice for both symmetric and asymmetric encryption.
        Libsodium: Known for being easier to use than OpenSSL, especially for key management and symmetric encryption.

    Implementing AES for Command Encryption:
        Use AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) for encrypting/decrypting command payloads between the server and agent.
        Generate a session key on the agent side, and encrypt it using RSA, then send it to the server securely. Once established, use AES for further communications.

    Example Workflow:
        Generate a 256-bit AES key on the agent.
        Encrypt the AES key with the server’s public RSA key.
        The server decrypts this with its private key, establishing a shared AES session key for symmetric encryption.

    AES Encryption Code in C: Here’s a basic example of AES encryption using OpenSSL’s library:

#include <openssl/aes.h>
#include <string.h>

void aes_encrypt(const unsigned char *key, const unsigned char *plaintext, unsigned char *ciphertext) {
    AES_KEY encrypt_key;
    AES_set_encrypt_key(key, 256, &encrypt_key);
    AES_encrypt(plaintext, ciphertext, &encrypt_key);
}

void aes_decrypt(const unsigned char *key, const unsigned char *ciphertext, unsigned char *plaintext) {
    AES_KEY decrypt_key;
    AES_set_decrypt_key(key, 256, &decrypt_key);
    AES_decrypt(ciphertext, plaintext, &decrypt_key);
}

    Key Management: Store keys securely in memory and overwrite them after use to reduce exposure.
    Padding: AES requires fixed-size blocks, so use padding to ensure data aligns with the AES block size (typically 128 bits or 16 bytes).

Implementing RSA for Key Exchange:

    Use RSA to securely share the AES session key. This can be implemented with OpenSSL as well.
    RSA is asymmetric, meaning you’ll use the server’s public key to encrypt the AES key, and the server will use its private key to decrypt it.

Example of RSA Encryption:

    #include <openssl/rsa.h>
    #include <openssl/pem.h>

    int rsa_encrypt(const unsigned char *message, const char *public_key_file, unsigned char *encrypted) {
        FILE *fp = fopen(public_key_file, "rb");
        RSA *rsa = PEM_read_RSA_PUBKEY(fp, NULL, NULL, NULL);
        int result = RSA_public_encrypt(strlen(message), message, encrypted, rsa, RSA_PKCS1_OAEP_PADDING);
        RSA_free(rsa);
        fclose(fp);
        return result;
    }

        Store the server’s public key on the agent securely or include it at compile time.
        The server decrypts this AES key using its private key, establishing a secure session.

## Step 3: Integrate pinggy and Test Encrypted Communication

    Expose C2 Server with pinggy:
        Use pinggy to expose your C2 server with a public IP and port.
        Configure the agent to communicate with the public IP and port from pinggy, and test the secure (AES-encrypted) communication between the agent and server.

    Testing:
        Test the encryption and decryption functions separately to confirm they work correctly.
        Simulate command exchanges, ensuring that commands are encrypted by the server, decrypted by the agent, and that responses follow the same path securely.

## Step 4: Implement Telegram as an Additional Channel

Since Telegram’s API is JSON-based, integrating it with a C agent is more complex. You could either:

    Write a separate Python/C# process to handle Telegram communication, then interface this with the C-based agent.
    Use a lightweight HTTP library in C (like libcurl) to directly communicate with Telegram’s API if you want a pure C solution, though it may involve considerable work parsing JSON responses.

Example Workflow for Telegram Integration

    Send Commands via Telegram:
        Write a simple server process (in Python or any high-level language) that takes commands via a Telegram bot.
        Have this server relay commands to your C2 server, which then relays encrypted commands to the C agent.

    Receive Responses via Telegram:
        Alternatively, for a pure C setup, use Telegram’s getUpdates endpoint via HTTP requests to poll for messages from the bot, then execute these commands in your C agent.



## Change in plan

I will use python. To create the server with a .exe I can use wine, but dlls need to be included in the file:

wine C:/Python38/Scripts/pyinstaller.exe --onefile --add-binary "C:/Python38/python38.dll;." --log-level=DEBUG agent.py

The filw will be in the dist/ folder
